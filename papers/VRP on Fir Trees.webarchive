<p align="CENTER"><strong><font size="+1">Heuristics for Vehicle Routing on Fir
Trees</font></strong></p>



<p><strong></strong>     We describe two new heuristics for the collection of milk
by road tankers in rural New
Zealand.  Typically the road system encountered in this environment comprises a network of
farm roads, leading off a major highway which forms the spine of a tree-like network.  Farms
must be allocated to tanker collection routes, with tanker capacity being the major limitation. 
The heuristics developed attempt to minimize the total collection costs incurred by the fleet in
transporting the milk to a central processing facility.  Their development  approach takes
advantage of the tree-like structure of the network.  These two new heuristics and two previous
heuristics are applied to some test problems and the computational results are presented. </p>

<p align="CENTER"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>  The New Zealand dairy industry is organised on the basis of regional cooperative dairy
companies.  Milk collected from the client farmers (<em>suppliers</em>) is delivered by
special road
tankers (which are much like gasoline tankers) for processing at one or more factories operated
by the company.  A common objective of these companies for this operation is the minimization
of the collection cost per kilogram of milk.  In order to achieve this objective, planners group the
suppliers together into a <em>run </em> - a list of suppliers serviced in sequence by one tanker
in a specific
order.  Each run begins at a factory, collects the milk from the suppliers in turn (this is termed
<em>servicing </em>the supplier), and finally delivers the milk to the factory.  The total milk
collected in
a run cannot exceed the known, upper limit (<em>capacity</em>) of the tanker assigned to that
run.  A
<em>schedule </em>is a collection of runs that covers all the suppliers to be serviced in a shift. 
</p>

<p>  These issues are addressed by the  <em>Vehicle Routing Problem</em>
(VRP)<strong>, </strong>which <strong> </strong>is one of the
classical areas of study in operations research. VRP and its related problems have been studied
extensively (see, for example: Turner <em>et al</em>. (1974), Watson-Gandy and Foulds
(1981), Basnet
<em>et al</em>. (1993), Laporte and Nobert (1987), and Golden and Assad (1988)).  The
standard vehicle
routing problem assumes that each node in the underlying transportation network is directly
connected to many other nodes.  In practice, in attempting to apply VRP algorithms to rural dairy
farming areas in New Zealand, we found that this assumption is not valid.  The road networks
commonly encountered by New Zealand dairy company logistics managers often comprise a
network of farm roads, leading off a major highway, which forms the spine of a tree-like
network.  The network is not quite a tree in the sense that, while nearly all pairs of locations are
connected by unique paths, a relatively small number of pairs of nodes have multiple paths
between them.  This comes about due to:</p>


<p>  The mountainous terrain of rural New Zealand in which road building is extremely costly,
and </p>

<p>  The existence of some small districts (hamlets) of a few farms, each connected by a 
     network of a few roads, in remote areas at the end of a single public access road.</p>

<p>Figure 1 depicts a typical network for this scenario.  The pendant cyclic  structures
(<em>cones</em>) are
occasionally present (these are the hamlets, as described above).  Networks of the type just
described we term <em>fir trees</em>.  We define fir trees formally in the next section.</p>


<p></p><center><img src="Figure1.gif"></center><p></p>

<p>We have found that the following assumptions are often appropriate for the New Zealand
dairy
farm milk tanker routing scenario.</p>

<p>1.     Only a single uniform commodity (milk) is to be collected.</p>

<p>2.     The time horizon of interest is a shift (usually of not more than 12 hours) in which an 
identified set of suppliers has to be serviced.</p>

<p>3.     There is usually a single factory to which all the milk must be delivered.</p>

<p>4.     The best route (according to the previously defined objective) between each pair of 
suppliers and between each supplier and the factory is known.</p>

<p>5.     The company has at its disposal a fleet of a known number of tankers, whose capacity to
carry milk may vary between tankers.</p>

<p>6.     The underlying road network is acyclic  (once all roads and bridges that are infeasible for
tanker travel and all cones are removed), and may be represented as a fir tree as described
above.</p>

<p>7.     The driving time between each pair of locations, the time for servicing each supplier, and
the total combined driving and service time available to each tanker (which may vary 
between tankers) are all known.</p>

<p>  In this paper, we confine our attention to the variation of the VRP with the above
assumptions, which we denote by<strong> VRPFT</strong> (<em>Vehicle Routing
Problem  on Fir Trees</em>).  An
acceptable surrogate for minimum cost/kg collection is the total distance travelled by all tankers
in collecting and delivering all the milk to the factory.  Thus the objective is one of minimising
this total distance travelled and the best routes are defined in terms of the shortest distance over
routes which are feasible for tanker travel.  The currently available heuristics for VRP could be
used for VRPFT. However, the reason for developing new heuristics is to be able to exploit the
particular tree-like structure.  By exploiting this structure, we aim to find heuristics that  are able
to solve the particular  problems  having this structure faster than the currently available
heuristics, which are for the more general VRP.</p>

<p>  The problem of capacitated vehicle routing on trees (TCVRP) has been studied by
LabbÃ©
<em>et al.</em> (1991).  Assuming uniform capacities  and a tree network,  they present a
branch and bound
algorithm which solves problems of up to 140 suppliers in reasonable computational time. 
Rennie (1995) relaxed this formulation to allow for the splitting of the suppliers to different runs
and presented a single-pass construction heuristic. Her heuristic was devised for the milk tanker
routing operations of an actual New Zealand dairy company, but has not been implemented.  She
suggested that successful implementation depends upon extending her heuristic to account for
the disparity in the capacities of the tankers, and for trees that have few additional links that
cause the trees to become networks.</p>

<p>  The rest of the paper is laid out as follows:  In Section 2, we develop a formal statement
of the VRPFT and  describe a procedure to convert the VRPFT to a TCVRP.  Section 3 describes
two new heuristics for the TCVRP, and Section 4 presents some computational results.  The
paper ends with some overall conclusions.</p>


<p align="CENTER"><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong></p>

<p><strong>    </strong>A statement of the vehicle routing problem on a fir tree
(VRPFT) is now developed
following the notation of LabbÃ© <em>et al</em>. (1991) and standard graph theoretic
terminology (see, for
instance, Foulds (1994)).   Let T= (V<sub>T</sub>, E<sub>T</sub>) be a tree where
V<sub>T</sub> = {v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub> ...., v<sub>n</sub>} is the
vertex set,
with v<sub>1</sub> denoting the factory and v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>...,
v<sub>n</sub> denoting the suppliers.  E<sub>T</sub> =  {( v<sub>i</sub>,
v<sub>j</sub>); 1 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt;= n} is
the arc set representing the main roads connecting the factory and the suppliers.  Let
d<sub>ij</sub> be the
length of arc (v<sub>i</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>) representing the distance between suppliers
v<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>j</sub>.  Let q<sub>i</sub> (&gt;0) be the
output of the supplier represented by node v<sub>i</sub>, with q<sub>1</sub> = 0.  There
is a fleet of m tankers, each with
capacity Q, based at the factory.  </p>

<p>  Consider now adding to the tree T a finite number p of subgraphs of the form
C<sup>i</sup>  = (V<sub>C</sub><sup>i</sup>,
E<sub>C</sub><sup>i</sup>), for i = 1,2, ..., p, where each
V<sub>C</sub><sup>i</sup>  represents  a vertex set of additional suppliers,  and each
E<sub>C</sub><sup>i</sup>  is the arcset representing the roads between these suppliers,
and, </p>

<p align="CENTER">| V<sub>C</sub><sup>i</sup>     V<sub>T</sub> | = 1, i =
1,2, .., p.</p>

<p>Each of the subgraphs C<sup>i</sup> is termed a<em> cone</em>.   The resulting graph
G =  (V, E) where</p>

<p align="CENTER">V  = V<sub>T</sub>  V<sub>C</sub><sup>1</sup> 
V<sub>C</sub><sup>2</sup>   ...  V<sub>C</sub><sup>p</sup> ,  and</p>

<p align="CENTER">E  = E<sub>T</sub>  E<sub>C</sub><sup>1</sup> 
E<sub>C</sub><sup>2</sup>   ...  E<sub>C</sub><sup>p</sup> </p>

<p>is termed a <strong>fir tree</strong> iff </p>

<p align="CENTER">| V<sub>T</sub> | Â» | V<sub>C</sub><sup>i</sup> |, i = 1, 2,
..., p</p>

<p>To give an idea of magnitudes, | V<sub>C</sub><sup>i</sup> | may usually be less
than 10, while | V<sub>T</sub> | may be about  300.
A particular instance of G is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>  The VRPFT consists of determining a set of runs (tanker collection routes on G) such that
the  assumptions in Section 1 are observed.  LabbÃ© <em>et al</em>. (1991) show that
the TCVRP is NP -
hard.  It is straightforward to extend their result, by applying the same polynomial transformation
of a particular bin packing problem, to show that VRPFT is also NP - hard.  This reinforces the
need to identify efficient heuristics to solve large scale problems which occur in New Zealand
dairy industry.  </p>


<p><strong>Transformation of VRPFT into TCVRP</strong></p>

<p>  One possible start to the identification of such a heuristic is to convert G, the underlying
graph, into a tree and apply the TCVRP heuristics to the problem. This conversion can be
accomplished as follows.  The suppliers of each hamlet can be notionally merged with the
supplier in the hamlet closest to the factory.  The output and service time of this supplier can be
set equal to the total output and total service time for the hamlet.  This corresponds to merging
all the nodes of each cone with the node closest to v<sub>1</sub>, (say v<sub>k</sub>)
and setting q<sub>k</sub> as the sum of the q<sub>i</sub>'s
of all nodes in the cone.  A travelling salesperson  solution procedure can be used to determine
the least-distance collection route for a single tanker to service the entire hamlet.  Fortunately this
is feasible as, for the scenario in question, total hamlet output is invariably significantly less than
the capacity of the smallest tanker.  Finally the distance d<sub>k1</sub> is increased to allow
for the distance
travelled in traversing the optimal travelling salesperson tour around the hamlet. This procedure 
is described by the following pseudocode:</p>


<p><strong>Transforming VRPFT into TCVRP</strong></p>

<p>Repeat for each cone</p>

<p>  Construct a travelling salesperson optimal tour</p>

<p>  Increase the length of the arc connecting the cone to the rest of the fir tree by the length
of the tour</p>

<p>  Increase the service time of the suppliers in the cone closest to the factory by the total
time to service the cone</p>

<p>  Remove the cone from the tree, leaving the node where service time has just been
increased <strong></strong></p>

<p>until no cones are found</p>

<p>  The above procedures transform G into a tree T, and now we have a TCVRP to solve. 
We now go on to discuss the heuristics designed to solve TCVRP.  </p>


<p><strong>Heuristics for TCVRP</strong></p>

<p>  To our knowledge there are only two papers in the open literature, by LabbÃ©
<em>et al</em>. (1991)
and Rennie (1995),  that present heuristics for the problem of vehicle routing on trees.  The first
paper develops upper bounds and lower bounds for the problem, which are then included in a
branch and bound search for the exact solution.  The second paper uses the upper bound of the
first paper to construct a heuristic for the TCVRP.  We shall now discuss these approaches
briefly
before presenting two new heuristics for the TCVRP.  It may be noted that while our heuristics
can be easily adapted to the case of unequal tanker capacities and time window constraints, we
ignore time windows and assume homogeneous tankers in what follows.</p>


<p><strong>Branch and bound solution</strong></p>

<p>  LabbÃ© <em>et al</em>. (1991) proposed a linear time heuristic to obtain an
upper bound for the
TCVRP.  It consists of successive construction of vehicle routes, where any pendant vertex is
successively merged with the adjacent vertex until the combined load exceeds the capacity of the
trucks (in a tree, a pendant vertex is a node that is connected to only one other node in the tree,
and consequently this other node is the first node on the path to the root).  Then, if the pendant
vertex load is higher than the adjacent vertex load, a vehicle route is allocated to the pendant
vertex and its associated merged nodes (see LabbÃ© <em>et al</em>., 1991, for further
details) .  Otherwise,
a vehicle is allotted to the adjacent vertex and its associated merged nodes, replacing the adjacent
vertex by the pendant node.  This allocation of vehicles continues until all the loads are picked
up.  Using this upper bound, and a lower bound constructed from the solution of an associated
bin packing problem, LabbÃ© <em>et al.</em> created a branch and bound search for the
exact solution of the
TCVRP.  They showed that the upper bound (UP BND) is quite close to the exact solution (OPT)
for the problems solved by them.</p>


<p><strong>Sequential greedy algorithm (RH)</strong></p>

<p>  Rennie relaxed the TCVRP to allow the possibility of splitting the loads at the nodes. 
The UP BND stops merging pendant nodes and adjacent nodes when the load exceeds the
capacity.  Rennie (1995) points out that when this limit is reached the UP BND can possibly be
improved by trying to merge with the pendant nodes those nodes which are closer toward the root
of the tree (not necessarily the adjacent one).  In this case, Rennie uses a savings approach to
select new nodes to merge with the pendant node under consideration.  The node that provides
the maximum savings in collection distance without violating the capacity constraint is selected. 
We now go on to discuss two new heuristics for the TCVRP.</p>


<p><strong>The Heuristic H1</strong></p>

<p><strong>    </strong> We have already shown how to pre-process the underlying
network so that it is
transformed into a tree.  We propose a remarkably simple modification of the VRP heuristic first
introduced by Clarke and Wright (1964).  As is well known, these authors begin by first
constructing as many runs as there are suppliers - each supplier is alone on a unique run. They
then progressively combine runs, subject to tanker capacity, in a myopic, greedy fashion, based
on the maximum savings (in total distance travelled) by run combination.  We propose this
general approach for the TCVRP.</p>

<p>  The approach is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows two nodes v<sub>i</sub>  and
v<sub>j</sub> , while v<sub>1</sub>
represents the rest of the path up to the root. Consider the possible combination of  two runs, one
including the supplier at v<sub>i</sub> and the other including the supplier at
v<sub>j</sub> .   </p>

<p></p><center><img src="Figure2.gif"></center><p></p>

<p>  With reference to Figure 2, these runs are &lt;v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>i</sub>,
v<sub>1</sub> &gt; and &lt; v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>j</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>&gt;
respectively.  (In
later stages of the process, there may be other suppliers on the runs, but the logic is analogous.) 
Let  v<sub>k</sub> be the farthest node present in both paths from v<sub>1</sub> to
v<sub>i</sub>, and from v<sub>1</sub> to v<sub>j</sub>, as shown.  Then,
whether v<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>k</sub> are identical or not, the saving in total distance
travelled by the combination
of the two runs, s<sub>ij</sub> say, is 2d<sub>1k</sub>.  Initially, for each subtree, a
unique run is constructed for each
supplier, as described.  The largest saving will occur when 2d<sub>1k</sub> is largest, i.e.
when two runs
passing through one farthest node are  merged. A test is made to establish whether or not the
combined run, R say, is feasible in the sense that the tanker has sufficient capacity.  This
combination process is continued until there are no more feasible run combinations to be found. 
</p>

<p>  In this way the special tree structure permits simplified identification of the maximum
potential savings, which consists of attempting to merge two runs both passing through the
farthest pendant vertex.  This lends higher efficiency to this heuristic.</p>

<p>  It is assumed that the total supplier output for the whole network will be significantly
larger than the total tanker capacity.  This necessitates multiple runs being assigned to most, if
not all, tankers.  In the present dairy company scenario, it is usual for every tanker to make three
to five runs per shift.  To summarize, the heuristic proceeds as follows:</p>


<p><strong>Heuristic H1</strong></p>

<p>Construct initial runs for all the suppliers, with a single supplier on each run.</p>

<p>Associate each run with its single supplier node.</p>

<p>Construct a list of runs sorted in non-decreasing distance of their associated node from the
factory (root).</p>

<p>While there are runs not associated with the root do</p>

<p>  For the run i with its associated node v at the greatest distance from the root, </p>

<p>       Call Combine (i, v)</p>

<p>       Resort the list of runs</p>

<p>  end For</p>

<p>end While</p>

<p>end H1</p>


<p>Procedure Combine (i, v)</p>

<p>For the candidate run i,</p>

<p>Find another run, which is associated with the same node v, that can be combined with run i. 
(Runs can combine if the combined load is less than vehicle capacity).  If more than one
combination found, choose the combination that will create a run closest to vehicle capacity.</p>

<p>If another run found (combination is successful),   </p>

<p>  Create a combined run with associated node v.</p>

<p>  Remove original runs</p>

<p>Else (combination unsuccessful)</p>

<p>  Associate run i with parent of the currently associated node v</p>

<p>End if</p>

<p>End Combine</p>


<p><strong>The Heuristic H2</strong></p>

<p>In contrast to the above, the second heuristic we have developed starts from an infeasible
solution, and moves to make the solution feasible. We start by trying to fit the whole tree into
one
run.  The tree is subdivided if it is not possible.  This continues until the tree is divided into
feasible runs.  This heuristic proceeds as given below.</p>


<p><strong>Heuristic H2</strong></p>

<p>Create a single run that collects all suppliers</p>

<p>While there are  runs that can not be assigned to the tankers</p>

<p>  Choose the largest, unassigned run</p>

<p>  Split the run into two runs at the node which is closest to the root, ignoring the supplier
at the branching node</p>

<p>end While</p>

<p>{Assign the suppliers at the branching nodes}</p>

<p>Order the branching nodes in the order of non-decreasing distance from the root.</p>

<p>For each branching node</p>

<p>  If possible, assign the node to a run passing through the node</p>

<p>  Otherwise,</p>

<p>       Create a new run to collect this branching node.</p>

<p>End For</p>

<p>End H2</p>


<p align="CENTER"><strong>COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS</strong></p>

<p>  To test the computational performance of the heuristics, we generated randomly a number
of numerical instances of the problem, and applied the heuristics to them. In generating the
problems, any node had a 0.24 probability of having a supplier associated with it.  A node had
a 0.033 probability  of not having branches. Each edge has a distance anywhere between the
integral values from 1 to 100. The sprouting of branches from a node with a supplier associated
with it depended on the following probabilities.  The probability of no branches stemming from
it is equal to (the number of suppliers assigned to nodes) /(the number of total suppliers to assign
to nodes); the probability of 1 branch  is equal to Â¼ Ã— (the number of suppliers yet to be assigned
to nodes) / (the number of total suppliers to assign to nodes); and the probability of 2 branches 
is equal to Â¾Ã— (the number of suppliers yet to be assigned to nodes) / (the number of total
suppliers to assign to nodes).  A node with no assigned supplier would always sprout two
branches unless all the suppliers had been assigned.  For each tree, the supplier demands were
uniformly distributed within a range, e.g. [10, 90].  The tanker capacity was defined as 100.  Ten
problems were generated for each setting of the number of suppliers and evaluated on a
PC-compatible 486 DX2-66.  The heuristics H1 and H2 were applied, and the solutions obtained. 
The same problems were also solved using the upper bound (UP BND) and the exact algorithm
(OPT) of LabbÃ© <em>et al.</em> (1991)  and Rennie's (1995) sequential greedy
heuristic (RH).  We
programmed these on the basis of the algorithms given in their articles.<em>  It may be noted
that
Rennie allows splitting of suppliers, but Rennie's heuristic as implemented here does not allow
this splitting.</em> The number of suppliers (n), total distance (scaled by dividing the distance
achieved by a heuristic by the smallest distance obtained for that problem by all the heuristics),
and the time taken by the algorithms in seconds are shown in Table 1. These results are the
average of 10 replications.  </p>

<p align="CENTER">*  <font size="-1">The optimal solution was not found because the
search tree exceeded computer memory</font></p>

<p>It can be seen from Table 1 that all the heuristics come relatively close to the exact solution. 
In
general the algorithms, in order of the least total distance, are H1, RH, UP BND, and H2.  
Although H2 starts with the least total distance, it needs to <strong>split runs</strong> to
achieve feasibility. 
Essentially, it simply splits runs until feasibility is attained.  In splitting these runs, it creates
many runs that may have significant unused capacity.   Hence its performance is the poorest.  The
UP BND tries to build runs <strong>one at a time</strong> and stops adding suppliers to
a run as soon as a
supplier that would exceed the tanker capacity is found.  RH improves on the UP BND by  trying
to add more suppliers to a run by using a saving metric, and accomplishes further reduction in
total distance.  H1 considers <strong>all the runs together</strong>, trying to find a
combination that would
reduce the total distance the most.  The better results achieved by H1 may be attributed to this
global approach.  But as can be expected, their computational time is in the reverse of this order. 
However, although H1 is slowest, its timing is still sufficiently fast to make repeated use of it (for
'what-if' analyses) viable in an on-line environment.  </p>

<p>A realistic problem may have the number of suppliers (n) from 200 upwards.   These
problems
would be solved two times a day (for two shifts of tanker drivers), and the OPT approach would
be too slow, particularly for the 'what-if' analyses.  However, this is manageable in rapid times
with the heuristics.  </p>

<p align="CENTER"><strong><font size="+1">CONCLUSIONS</font></strong></p>

<p>In this paper we have introduced a special type of  vehicle routing -  on fir tree-like networks
(VRPFT).  We have proposed a procedure to convert the VRPFT into the problem of capacitated
vehicle routing on trees (TCVRP).  We presented two new algorithms for this problem, which
were then compared with previously available algorithms.  The heuristic H1 appears to give
better solutions than others in reasonable computational time, whereas the heuristic H2 is much
faster than other algorithms but the solution provided by it is inferior.  Thus  H1 appears suitable
for large-scale practical problems arising in the New Zealand dairy industry.  These heuristics
can be easily modified to account for heterogenous vehicle capacities and time window
constraints. </p>

<p>  The runs constructed by the algorithms can be subjected to the r-optimal arc swapping
improvement procedures of Lin and Kernighan (1973).  We have tried the 2-optimal procedure
on the solutions provided by these algorithms but it does not appear to yield any significant
improvement, especially considering the additional time needed.</p>
