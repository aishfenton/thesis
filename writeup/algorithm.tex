Design goals:
\begin{itemize}
   \item Fast
   \item Minimal
   \item Take advantage of modern parallel hardware
\end{itemize}

\section{Algorithm}

% - Infeasible solutons admisible, just penalisted. Helps escape local minimum, like in TABUROUTE. 

% - Avoid the problem of Tabu Search moving cities around the depot more frequently, because removes are random. \cite{Taillard:1993}.

% - Takes advantage of Taillards observation that the move between tours don't need to be huge. It is suffient to move to the tour in an adjoining segment. This is achieved here by the NEAREST cities list, and much simplier and quicker.

% \subsubsection{Starting points}

%   * Intial starting thingie ? k-means
% We use kmeans clustering. The kmeans algorithm isn't guaranteed to produce the same result each run. This is conventionally viewed as limitation of the algorithm. However for our purpose this is an advantage as we can use the randomness to better seed the population with different solutions.
